      Differece Between location and history object: <br />
      Locarion Object: The location property of a window is a reference to a
      Location object, which is a representation of the URL of the document
      currently being displayed in that window. The href property of the
      Location object is a string that contains the complete text of the URL.
      Other properties of this object, such as protocol, host, pathname, and
      search specify the various individual parts of the URL.<br />
      <br />
      History Object: The history property of the Window object refers to a
      History object for the window. The History object is an array of the URLs
      in the browsing history of the window or frame. For a top-level Navigator
      window, the History object is a representation of the contents of the
      browser's Go menu. A user's browsing session history is private
      information and, so for security reasons, there are heavy restrictions on
      how the History object <br />
      can be used.
      <br />
      The Location object specifies the URL currently being displayed, and
      allows JavaScript code to load new URLs.<br />
      The History object contains information about the URLs that have been
      previously displayed in the window
